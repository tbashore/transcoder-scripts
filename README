This is a set of python scripts that transcode media files between some common formats. They will detect the number of cores on your system and transcode multiple files in parallel. Each transcoder script is called without arguments and will transcode all the files in the current directory that have a given extension (e. g. flactomp3.py will transcode *.flac to *.mp3).  The scripts depend on certain binary tools in your path (e.g. mp3 support requires that lame is installed somewhere in your path).
